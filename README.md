### User Stories:

#### Business Owner:

- As a business owner, I should be able to define and update company policies such as code of conduct, HR policies, etc., ensuring all employees are aware and compliant.

- As a business owner, I need to schedule and manage team meetings, including sending invites, setting agendas, and tracking attendance, to facilitate effective communication and collaboration.

- As a business owner, I need to manage project budgets, track expenses, and approve expenses submitted by team members, ensuring projects stay within budget constraints.

#### Employee:

- As an employee, I value having a centralized directory that provides detailed profiles of my colleagues, including their contact information and job roles, allowing for seamless collaboration and efficient communication.

- As an employee, I need to provide feedback on projects, processes, or team dynamics through anonymous surveys or suggestion boxes, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and employee engagement.

- As an employee, I have to be able to request flexible work arrangements such as remote work, flexible hours, or job sharing, supported by the company's policies and systems for managing work arrangements.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Unity Pulse is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React](https://react.dev/) library for building the user interface. React is a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive web applications.

- The backend of the application is powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, which allows for robust routing and middleware capabilities.

- For persistent storage (database), the application uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL database that provides flexible and scalable data management.

- The mobile app is developed using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), a framework that allows for the development of cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase.

- For styling, the application utilizes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid and efficient UI development.

- To enable real-time communication and live chatting, the application incorporates [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/), a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and server.
